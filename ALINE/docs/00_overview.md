### About the Event  
Junction 2025 is the flagship annual hackathon by Junction, bringing together interdisciplinary talent to build tech solutions over a weekend. With its “Utopia or Dystopia” theme, teams are encouraged to think not only *can* we build something, but *should* we—and what future does it imply.

### Why We’re In  
We’re entering Junction 2025 to test our skills in a high-velocity environment, exercise a modular agent-control mindset, and build something integrating data, signals, interfaces and LLM agents into a coherent system.  
The 48-hour weekend demands focus, clear role allocation, rapid prototyping, and strong value storytelling (demo + presentation + video + report).

---

### What We Want This Repo to Be  
This repository is our **central hub for documentation and brainstorming**.  
It will contain:  
- Strategy materials (challenge scouting, flow-charts, team roles)  
- System-design docs (agent frameworks, architecture, memory/db design)  
- Deliverables skeletons (presentation, video script, report)  
- Links to our code repo (VS Code + GitHub + branches)  

**Note:** Actual code development happens in separate branches/features within this repo and via VS Code/GitHub + Copilot/LLM tools.

---

### Key Success Factors for the Weekend  
1. Quick challenge pick: select a partner challenge early and apply our value-mapping process.  
2. Clear system architecture: front-end + backend + memory/db + agent logic.  
3. Modular scaffold: rapid spin-up of components (Docker, Postgres, Chroma, LLM inference) so we can focus on unique logic.  
4. Strong story: in 48 h we must not only build but **sell** the value (presentation + video + report).  
5. Team flow: roles defined, branch strategy clear, documentation live, feedback loops active.

> _“Our goal: Transformers for signals… Agents for value… Interfaces for the human future.”_  
Let’s build something that goes beyond “just a demo”—let’s build one that imagines “what if”.

### Next Step  
Proceed to `docs/01_strategy.md` to begin the **Challenge Scouting Matrix**: gather all announced partner challenges, map them by feasibility/value/interest, and pick 1-2 top candidates as our target.
