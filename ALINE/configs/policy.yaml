# ALINE Active Query Policy Configuration - Ticket 007
# Configuration for selecting top-k hourly slots for targeted sensing

# Priority score weights
# score_t = λ1 * entropy(p_t) + λ2 * mean(sigma_z_t) + λ3 * |∂p/∂Z_t|

weights:
  lambda1: 1.0  # Weight for entropy term (uncertainty in prediction)
  lambda2: 0.5  # Weight for posterior uncertainty term
  lambda3: 0.3  # Weight for gradient/impact term

# Number of hours to select for querying
k: 3  # Select top 3 hours per day

# Migraine prediction model parameters (from simulator)
migraine_model:
  weights: [0.5, 0.4, 0.45, 0.35]  # [stress, sleepDebt, hormonal, envLoad]
  bias: -1.8
