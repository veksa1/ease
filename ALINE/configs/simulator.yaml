# Make episodes more persistent + a bit stronger coupling
state_transition_matrix:
  - [0.85, 0.15, 0.05, 0.05]   # stress: more persistence, sleep feeds into stress
  - [0.10, 0.80, 0.05, 0.10]   # sleepDebt: stronger persistence
  - [0.05, 0.05, 0.90, 0.05]   # hormonal: high persistence (quasi-trend / cycle)
  - [0.10, 0.05, 0.05, 0.85]   # envLoad: more persistence

# Stronger feature → latent influence
input_weights:
  stress: 0.05        # was 0.01
  sleep: 0.06         # was 0.01
  hormonal: 0.04      # was 0.008
  environmental: 0.03 # was 0.005

# Keep noise similar so we still get variability but not pure noise

  stress: 0.15
  sleepDebt: 0.12
  hormonal: 0.10

# Make latents matter much more for migraine risk
migraine_model:
  # Stronger weights so that high-stress / high-debt / hormonal peaks really stand out
  weights: [1.6, 1.4, 1.8, 0.9]   # [stress, sleepDebt, hormonal, envLoad]
  # Start with a slightly more negative bias to avoid migraine rate exploding
