# 🧰 Ticket 012 – Demo Scripts, README, and Minimal CI

**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Owner:** DevEx / ML
**Status:** 🔧 To Do
**Goal:** Ship a runnable demo with one command, plus a lightweight CI to lint and unit-test core pieces.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Make it trivial for teammates to:

* Build/run containers
* Generate synthetic data
* Train the model (small epoch count)
* Launch FastAPI and hit endpoints with sample JSON

---

## 📂 Inputs

| File                        | Description               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `Makefile`                  | Phony targets             |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` | Lint + tests              |
| `README.md`                 | Quickstart guide          |
| `examples/`                 | Sample requests/responses |

---

## 🧩 Tasks

1. **Makefile** targets: `data`, `train`, `serve`, `eval`, `viz`.
2. **README**: step-by-step with copy-paste blocks.
3. **CI**: run `pytest -q`, `ruff`/`flake8`, and a smoke test of FastAPI (import & `/health`).

---

## 🧠 Integration

* Pulls everything together for the hackathon demo.
* Provides artifacts to UI team (sample JSONs + plots).

---

## ✅ Deliverables

* [ ] `README.md` with quickstart
* [ ] `Makefile`
* [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`
* [ ] Green CI badge on repo
